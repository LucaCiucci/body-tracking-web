# Sequence

TODO description

## Scripting

Each sequence is represented by a **"script"**, each script is a list of commands that tells the app what to do.

Scripts can be written in the following formats:
 - `DullScript` (`.ds`): a simple scripting language, see [DullScript](./langs/dullscript/) for more info.
 - `JavaScript` (`.js`): a JavaScript file, see [JavaScript](./langs/javascript/) for more info.
 - `TypeScript` (`.ts`): a TypeScript file, see [TypeScript](./langs/typescript/) for more info.

The DullScript format is the recommended and the default one since is the most simple and easy to use.

It is advised to pick a language from [here](./langs/), for example [DullScript](./langs/dullscript/) and check out [this list](./langs/commands.md) of commands that can be used.
